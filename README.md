# DisneylandGenerator
 
The goal of this project was to use Javascript to take three sets of data and output it, so I decided to create a fun little Disneyland itinerary generator. It was good to practice using math.floor and math.random along with arrays. I decided to style it with some HTML and CSS even though the assignment just called for the program. Eventually I'd like to come back and do more work on it, so that it's a bit more like an actual itinerary with multiple things to do.
